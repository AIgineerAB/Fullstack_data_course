[![video](streamlit styling using CSS)](https://youtu.be/rkLzMLhCBiI)



In this lecture we'll work with styling the dashboard. Instead of markdown we'll use different types of text sizeing in streamlit.

```py
st.title
st.header
st.subheader
st.write
```

Also we'll go into CSS and how to get it to work with streamlit. In CSS we'll work with variables, selectors, modular scale and more.
