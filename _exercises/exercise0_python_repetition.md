## 0. Hire IT employee data

In a company `Hire IT`, there are these employees.

| employeeID | name    | department | salary |
| ---------: | :------ | :--------- | ------ |
|          0 | Alice   | HR         | 31000  |
|          1 | Bob     | IT         | 41000  |
|          2 | Charlie | HR         | 28000  |

&nbsp; a) Create a list of dictionaries to represent this data, where each dictionary represents each row.

&nbsp; b) Extract the second record in this dataset.

&nbsp; c) Extract all rows from this dataset and print it in this format

```
Alice works in department HR and earns 31000.
Bob works in department IT and earns 41000.
Charlie works in department HR and earns 28000.
```

&nbsp; d) Find out the average salary in Hire IT.

&nbsp; e) Find out the average salary among the HR department in Hire IT.

&nbsp; f) Extract all records where the department is HR.

&nbsp; g) Find all unique departments in this list.

For the following exercises the data has now been updated with the age column

| employeeID | name    | department | salary | age |
| ---------: | :------ | :--------- | ------ | --- |
|          0 | Alice   | HR         | 31000  | 26  |
|          1 | Bob     | IT         | 41000  | 37  |
|          2 | Charlie | HR         | 28000  |     |

&nbsp; h) Add this age column into our list of dictionaries. `None` should be used for empty fields.

&nbsp; i) A new employee named David starts at the IT department, with salary 35000 and has the age 30. Create a function to add this record to the dataset.
