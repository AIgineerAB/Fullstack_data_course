Read this dataset from the data directory and 

&nbsp; a) Do some initial EDA on this dataset. For example checking null values, look at some statistical properties. 

&nbsp; b) See if there are some null values that you can fill in based on your domain knowledge within the data field. 

&nbsp; c) Find out some statistical information about the salary, e.g. mean, median, min, max, 10 percentile and 90 percentile. 

&nbsp; d) Group by different roles and take the median and average salaries for each group.  

&nbsp; e) Group by different departments and take the median and average salaries for each group.
