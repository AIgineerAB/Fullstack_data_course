In this first lecture about streamlit, we'll go through the fundamentals and not get stuck on structuring the code. In later lecture we'll go through a structure that could be more extensible and more composable to build larger dashboard applications. 

## Setup 

We'll install streamlit 

```bash 
uv pip install streamlit openpyxl
```
