Supervised learning is a part of machine learning, where algorithms learn from a training data set.
These algorithms try to make sense of the data by matching inputs to corresponding outputs.
In supervised learning, each data point in the training set is labeled with the correct output, which allows the algorithm to learn from the examples.
This allows the algorithm to make predictions on unseen data, based on its training.
It is used for tasks such as classification, where the goal is to assign a label to input data, and regression, where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable.
Supervised learning has many applications in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and financial forecasting.
