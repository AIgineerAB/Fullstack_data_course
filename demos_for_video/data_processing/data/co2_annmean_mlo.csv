# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
#
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
#
# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm
#
# NOTE: Due to the eruption of the Mauna Loa Volcano, measurements from Mauna Loa Observatory
# were suspended as of Nov. 29, 2022 and resumed in July 2023.
# Observations starting from December 2022 to July 4, 2023 are from a site at the
# Maunakea Observatories, approximately 21 miles north of the Mauna Loa Observatory.
