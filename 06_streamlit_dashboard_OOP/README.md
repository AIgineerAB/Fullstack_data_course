## Setup 

Before getting started with this, you should understand the basics of Python OOP, if not please revisit it in order to easier follow along the video.

Go into kaggle to find [this dataset on olympic games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishsharma01/olympics-124-years-datasettill-2020?resource=download). We will in the lecture work with the summer games only, but you are encouraged to also implement frontend dashboard with both summer and winter games.  

Also you are encouraged to do more extensive and in depth EDA on both datasets. The one done in the video is very simple one, just to get started.
